            As an experienced Capoeira Instructor with over 24 years of practice, my aim is to offer more than just the physical aspects of this beautiful art form. My workshops are designed for capoeira practitioners of all levels, where we delve into the music, movement, and theory that make Capoeira a unique and enriching experience.

            What sets my workshops apart is the integration of my background in cultural anthropology. This perspective allows us to explore not just the “how” but more importantly the “why” behind each aspect of Capoeira. In traditional teaching methods, the focus is often on demonstrating techniques without fully exploring the context and reasons behind them. I believe that understanding the cultural, historical, and social dimensions of Capoeira enriches your practice and deepens your connection to this art form.

            In these workshops, you will embark on a journey that transcends the physical movements. We will utilize tools from cultural anthropology, music theory, and a physiological understanding of human body movement to provide a comprehensive understanding of Capoeira. Whether it's the intricate rhythms of the berimbau or the fluid dynamics of the ginga, each element is dissected and appreciated within its broader cultural significance.

            My goal is not just to instruct but to guide you in exploring Capoeira as a holistic practice. This approach makes Capoeira more approachable and meaningful, regardless of your experience level. Join me in these workshops to deepen your understanding, enhance your skills, and connect more profoundly with the rich legacy of Capoeira. Together, let’s embark on this journey of discovery and growth in the world of Capoeira.
